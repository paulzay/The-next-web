# Project 6 - Building with Responsive Design

This is an assigned collaborative project where we had to build a responsive webpage for three different screen sizes:

 - Mobile screen size
 - Tablet screen size
 - Laptop/Desktop screen size. 

 We are cloning the <a href="https://thenextweb.com/">The Next Web </a> website. It is a clone in terms of layout and its responsiveness.
